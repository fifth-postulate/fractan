## Introduction
[Fractan][fractan] is a programming language
> a Turing-complete esoteric programming language invented by the mathematician John Conway. A FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive fractions together with an initial positive integer input n. The program is run by updating the integer n as follows:
>
> 1. for the first fraction f in the list for which nf is an integer, replace n by nf
> 2. repeat this rule until no fraction in the list produces an integer when multiplied by n, then halt.
